## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

It is not necessary to install additional libraries to run the code beyond Anaconda. Everything will run perfectly with a Python 3.x version.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I am living in Munich and when I travel to other places and countries I usually use Airbnb a lot. Considering always the same questions as probaly everyone in my case.

1. Will I find quickly an suitable apartment?
2. Do I have to share my apartment or will I spent al the time there alone?
3. What factors contributed to an appropriate price?
4. Which district shall I choose based on an appropriate price?
5. Which influence does the season have to an appropriate price? 

This project was also part of my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree and helped me to improve my skills and knowledge about data analytics.
